;;; Commentary:

;; Select text in a Magit diff, a file, a dired listing, an agent-shell
;; transcript or any other buffer, write a remark, and keep going.  The
;; remarks collect in one global review.  From the review, mark some or all,
;; pick a live agent-shell session, and send them as one prompt rendered in
;; the wire format of a chosen agent app.
;;
;; Magit is optional: the Magit source is skipped when Magit is not loaded.
